This is a scratch repo for experimenting with Godot.

It includes some tools for drawing connected graphs and animating algorithms,
as well as a text terminal conttrol and experiments for connecting Godot with J.

Until I get around to collecting them here, you can see some screenshots of these experiments on my twitter feed:

**WARNING:** Nothing in here should be considered stable or production quality.

For slightly more polished work, see:

- https://github.com/tangentstorm/jprez (j presentation tool, which these experiments are meant to support)
